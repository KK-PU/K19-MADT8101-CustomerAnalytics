The features of each clusters are `4 clusters` :

 - `cluster 1` : High Performers The top performers in MLM programs are very responsive to discounts and promotional offers. resulting in more frequent purchases and higher average spending.
 - `cluster 2` : Growing cluster Individuals who fall between the beginner and the high-performing groups. Be price sensitive and only buy when they see a good deal. They are not persuaded by simple marketing or advertising. and tend to have low average spending.
 - `cluster 3` : Potential Growth Maximum number of downline members compared to other clusters Be selective about their buying behavior and have significant spending tendencies when they make purchases. They have a relatively fast return pattern and enjoy the shopping experience at offline stores.
